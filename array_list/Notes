Question:
why does printing an array directly in java prints the address of the object and not the array itself?

In Java, when you try to print any object using System.out.println(), the toString() method of that
object is called by default. If an object does not override the toString() method,
it inherits the implementation from the Object class, which returns a string in this format:
ClassName@hashcode
